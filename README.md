Moshi moshi, Zaiden desu!

Despite having lived out almost all of my life in London, I do not conform to many British stereotypes. Though I can vouch
that there’s almost no one who doesn’t love a good cuppa over here.  My university studies entail a pursuit of Law, a most
fascinating subject that demands critical thinking and intellectual rigour.

There is a quintessential aspect I’ve found to be commonplace across all my favourite anime: they are profoundly character
driven and seek to extensively explore the human experience. This probably means that my favourite genre is Bildungsroman – 
stories about coming of age. Seeing a character growing up by learning from their mistakes and working hard to overcome their 
limitations is a truly rewarding experience.
